LIFE AT UNITED

College,if done right,is a time for self - discovery , meeting new people,and deciding the adult you want to be. It should be fun,freeing and educational. To help you make the
most of it, we have put together these best ways to spend time in College . HOW we spend our time at college (UNITED) are given below:

   GOING TO CLASS
      
	  Class is a place where many of your future lifelong relationships will form, and if you think about it , it really makes sense. In the beginning, you're still largely in a group
      of your peers. As you move forward, you'll take an interests in classmates,who are not only your age,but also sharing in your interests.Our class mentor our teacher SACHIN SIR
      is also a big part of our LIFE AT UNITED. Aside from the touchy-feel stuff,it is also best to hit the classroom because it may improve your understanding and be a teacher
      requirement.

    
   HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH FREINDS

      We realise that by saying to study and go to class,we are dangerously close to sounding uncool. That's why we'll now tell you to go out and have a good time with your friends
      It is important to spend our time with friends, go for concerts , movies and parties and make memories. All of these things can rejuvenate mental function and unburden you 
      from the stress of school and work and other not so fun factors that insert themselves into your post high school life.
	  
	  
   SPENDING TIME ALONE 
    
	  Time alone is precious commodity when you are uncertain of what you want to do with your life. Take it from someone, who had no clue as he/she was crossing the stage to collect
 	  his/her degree. By understanding who you are and what you like to do in the downtime, you are in a better position to pin point what passion you truly have in life. Pursue
	  hobbies and interests, and then listen to what those hobbies and interests are telling you. Then , find a way to monetize them.Be an observer really looking at the world
	  without judgement.Observe yourself looking at the world.Find something creative to try,give yourself permission to suck,and create,create,create.In a world where information
	  is available at your fingertips and everyone has an opinion to share,sometimes it's incredibly rewarding to trust that you have the answers you seek.The truth is, SOLITUDE
	  IS NECESSARY FOR OUR WELL-BEING AND POTENTIAL SUCCESS.
	  
	  
   AT MANDEEP'S TEA STALL

      It is not about the tea stall , its about environment, At that place like tea stalls especially OUR MANDEEP'S Tea Stall we share our views ,making memories, with our friends

      TEA STALL plays a very big and important role of OUR LIFE AT UNITED. It's not only students relaxing place it is also teacher's place as well. As we all like CHAI.

PURPOSE OF WRITING BLOG

The main goals of any university or college blog is to create content that educates and resonates. If you can do that,you'll be well on your way to attracting new web visitors and 
developing those visitors into prospects and ambassadors.

In today's era there's loads of demand for new and engaging content one of the best things to do is write about what you know , and what better topic than your studies and college
lifestyle?

Simply by sharing what you;re studying,not only focus on academics, how we live in our social life, how we interact with other people, exploring through our life or real life experience.
You don't want to make it too heavy on the lifestyle pieces because you won't be able to carve out much of a niche for yourself with that kind of content. Instead , focus the majority
of your posts on the details of your life or social life at college.
You may wondering what the social scene, will be like at college. Infact, that could be one of the factors in your decisions about whare to go. Making new friends and finding
your niche in college may seem like daunting task, but there are many easy ways to meet people on campus and begin paving the way for lifelong friendships.

Here are few things that we have share in our blog:

          MAKE VALUABLE CONNECTIONS FOR LIFE AFTER GRADUATION:
		       Life after graduation is something that many students feel they're not prepared for, which means there's an opening fo ryou to get ahead of the curve.
			   Networking is a great way to secure place on postgraduate courses of internship programs, and your blog holds the keys.
			          * Your network of contacts should be relevant to the career's you want to move towards.
					  * Never be afraid to approach someone and share your blog with them if don't ask, you'll never know if they are interested.
					  
		  SOPPORT YOUYR FELLOW STUDENTS:
                College is not all about studying and preparing your resume for what comes after,there is also a lot of growing you will do as an individual.
                One of the biggest changes in the last couple of years has been the way that society has openend up to the issue surrounding mental illness. College can be a
                stressful time for a number of different reasons:
                      * Moving away from home can be a daunting prospect for many , as you'll be distanced from the social structure you're known all your life.
                      * There's a constant stream of social engagements, events and opportunities taht some students find overwhelming.
					  
		  GET INVOLVED:
                Student life on campus has plenty to offer. From intramural sports and clubs to musicals , there are tons of different activities you can get involved in, whtaever your
                interests are. Joining campus activities during your first semester of college is a great way to make friends and get involved.

          DON'T BE PLUGGED INTO TECHNOLOGY 24/7.
                It is probably easier said thet done,but there are so many things you risk missing out on when you're constantly looking down at your phone or popping on your
                headphones. When you're lounging on the quad listening to a podcast, you alienate other students who might want you to join in on a pickup Frisbee game. Or , if
                you spend the time before class scrolling through your Instagram feed, fellow classmates might similarly ignore you instead of starting up a conversation.

          TALK TO YOUR CLASSMATES :
                This one is a definitely a good idae for practical reasons - you have a buddy to get notes from if you need to take a sick day; you have to go to group member
                for group projects;and,for the big final,you have a study buddy!
                But getting to know peer in your class is also helpful because it can introduce you to a whole new group of people that you would'nt necessarily hane known had
                you kept quiet,not to mention that it may make class a little less boring.
