            <p> We realise that by saying to study and go to class,we are dangerously close to sounding uncool. That's why we'll now tell you to go out and have a good time with your friends
                It is important to spend our time with friends, go for concerts , movies and paries and make memories. All of these things can rejuvenate mental function and unburden you
                from the stress of school and work and other not so fun factors that insert themselves into your post high school life</p>

                SPENDING TIME ALONE
            </div>
            <p>Time alone is precious commodity when you are uncertain of what you want to do with your life. Take it from someone, who had no clue as he/she was crossing the stage to collect
 	  his/her degree. By understanding who you are and what you like to do in the downtime, you are in a better position to pin point what passion you truly have in life. Pursue
	  hobbies and interests, and then listen to what those hobbies and interests are telling you. Then , find a way to monetize them.Be an observer really looking at the world
	  without judgement.In a world where information
	  is available at your fingertips and everyone has an opinion to share,sometimes it's incredibly rewarding to trust that you have the answers you seek.The truth is, SOLITUDE
	  IS NECESSARY FOR OUR WELL-BEING AND POTENTIAL SUCCESS.</p>
