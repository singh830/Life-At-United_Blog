           College is a crazy time. It's the intersection of life, money, education, career, and more. It's a time to learn, to figure out yourself, to be on your own, and to start to understand life. Simply by sharing what you're studying, not only focus on academics, how we live in our social life, how we interact with other people, exploring through our life or real life experience.
You don't want to make it too heavy on the lifestyle pieces because you won't be able to carve out much of a niche for yourself with that kind of content. Instead , focus the majority
of your posts on the details of your life or social life at college. </p>
